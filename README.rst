About
=====

PSA-prizes is a Python package for simple prize analyses of PSA-graded trading cards.

PSA (Professional Sports Authenticator) grades the authenticity and condition of sport cards, such as baseball and basketball, and cards from TCGs (trading card games) like Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh! and Pok√©mon. These `grades <https://www.psacard.com/resources/gradingstandards#cards>`_ provide credible categories for these sensible collectibles in which prizes can be compared.

Features
========

Web Scraping
------------

- Scrape the comprehensive data recorded by PSA on public sales of certified cards from the `Auction Prizes <https://www.psacard.com/auctionprices/>`_ section of their website

Basic Analysis
--------------

- Compute the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and numbers on the grade distribution, record unusual grade types and plot the paid prizes in publicly finalized trades over time
