About
=====

PSA-prizes is a Python package for simple prize analyses of PSA-graded trading cards.

`PSA <https://www.psacard.com>`_ (Professional Sports Authenticator) grades the authenticity and condition of sport cards, such as baseball and basketball, and cards from TCGs (trading card games) like Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh! and Pok√©mon. These `grades <https://www.psacard.com/resources/gradingstandards#cards>`_ provide credible categories for these sensible collectibles in which prizes can be compared.

Features
========

Web Scraping
------------

- Scrape the comprehensive data recorded by PSA on public sales of certified cards from the `Auction Prizes <https://www.psacard.com/auctionprices/>`_ register on their website

Basic Analysis
--------------

- Compute the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and numbers on the grade distribution, record unusual grade types and plot the prizes over time

Installation
============

Clone the package to a local directory:

.. code:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/tostenzel/psa-prizes

Example
=======

Specify the cards and grades of interest in ``input/input.csv`` (`Click <https://github.com/tostenzel/psa-prizes/blob/master/input/input.csv>`_ for an example):
