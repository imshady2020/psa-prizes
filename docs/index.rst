About
=====

*PSA-prizes* is a Python package for simple prize analyses of PSA-graded trading cards.

`PSA <https://www.psacard.com>`_ (Professional Sports Authenticator) grades the authenticity and condition of sport cards, such as baseball and basketball cards, and cards from TCGs (trading card games) like Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh! and Pok√©mon. The `grades <https://www.psacard.com/resources/gradingstandards#cards>`_ provide credible categories for these sensible collectibles in which prizes can be compared.
